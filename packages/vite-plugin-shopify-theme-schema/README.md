## Features

### Dynamic Shopify Setting Schemas

-   Build Shopify Setting schemas dynamically from Typescript, Javascript, and JSON files
-   Share and reuse schema partials between different files. Promotes efficient code reusability.
-   Benefit from the language support provided by IDEs such as VSCode and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) like autocompletion, formatting, collapsing
-   Use Typescript autocompletion to declare schema structure using my code library. Included types and validators range from generic to highly specific.

## Examples

See [**example_theme_config**](./example_theme_config/) folder for usage examples of [validators](./example_theme_config/global_settings/settings_colors.ts) and [types](./example_theme_config/global_settings/settings_typography.ts).

## Install

```sh
#npm
npm i @snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema -D

# yarn
yarn add @snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema -D

# pnp
pnpm add @snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema -D
```

For pnpm workspace:

```sh
pnpm add @snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema@workspace:*

pnpm --filter=[yourGlob] add @snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema@workspace:*
```

### Build

```sh
pnpm --filter=@snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema build
```

### Tests

```sh
# build example files
pnpm --filter=@snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema test:example
```

## Usage

Add `pluginShopifyThemeSchema` plugin to vite.config.js / vite.config.ts:

```js
import pluginShopifyThemeSchema from '@snailicide/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-schema'

/* * Example  * */
export default {
    plugins: [
        pluginShopifyThemeSchema({
            themeRoot: '.',
            sourceCodeDir: './src/global_settings',
            entryPoints: {
                'settings_schema.json': 'settings_schema.js',
            },
        }),
    ],
}
```

-   Create a `sourceCodeDir` directory under your theme's folder to hold the source files for your `settings_schema.json` or custom entrypoint.
-   Create a Javascript,Typescript or JSON file for each 'entrypoint' of your theme settings. You can compose different files to determine the settings sequence.
-   Make sure that your schema source directory is listed in your theme's `.shopifyignore` file to avoid errors when pushing code to Shopify.

### Options

```ts
import type { ShopifyLiquidModulesOptions } from './src/options'

/* * Default Options Available * */
const defaultobj: ShopifyLiquidModulesOptions = {
    themeRoot: '.',
    sourceCodeDir: './src',
    entryPoints: {
        'settings_schema.json': 'settings_schema.js',
    },
}
```

## Inspiration

### [vite-plugin-shopify-theme-settings](https://github.com/barrel/barrel-shopify/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-shopify-theme-settings) by Barrel NY

Since i am new vite plugin, i used this as my starting structure and was heavily inspired by the overall concept of the vite-plugin-shopify-theme-settings. I skipped looping thru the json directory and instead used an 'entryPoint' approach.
